	<h2>How to Use These Lessons:</h2>
	<p>These lessons are intended to allow the student to learn at their own pace.  The sidebar is arranged so that the student can easily jump back and forth between different sections of the tutorial.</p>
	<p>Start by downloading the necessary source files and code that is provided to you for each lesson.  These can be found under the 'Project Files' > 'Source Code / Images' tab in the sidebar of the lesson.</p>
	<p>Feel free to watch through the video in its entirety before getting started, or work alongside the instructor, whichever way you learn best is the proper method.</p>
